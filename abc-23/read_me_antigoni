 This version is the last one, verified to be ok.

The updates are that now in the "strash" command there is nothing done 
by me. We just know that after "strash" the circuit is already an AIG.

With the "check_fd" command, the truth tables of the outputs are created, 
the corresponding table.txt files and my_in.txt files are created and they
are feeded one by one in the c++, FD code.

The FD code returns an array of its results in "fd_result" and afterwads 
the my_in.txt files are deleted (the table.txt's rest).
